# Dependency Management Guidelines

## Current Status

### Successfully Updated
- **PyJWT**: 2.7.0 → 2.10.1 ✅
  - Security improvement with backward compatibility maintained
  - All security tests continue to pass

### System-Managed Packages (Cautious Approach)
- **cryptography**: 41.0.7 (system-managed, Debian package)
- **tensorflow**: 2.17.1 (major version stability for ML compatibility)
- **numpy**: 1.26.4 (compatibility with TensorFlow ecosystem)

## Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate dependencies from system packages
2. **Regular Security Scanning**: Use tools like `safety`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`
3. **CVE Monitoring**: Monitor security advisories for core packages
4. **Staged Updates**: Test updates in development before production

### Critical Package Assessment
- **cryptography 41.0.7**: Current version from 2023, no critical CVEs affecting this use case
- **tensorflow 2.17.1**: Recent stable version, ML model compatibility maintained
- **PyJWT 2.10.1**: Updated for latest security patches ✅

## Update Strategy

### High Priority (Security-Critical)
- Authentication/authorization libraries (PyJWT ✅)
- Cryptographic libraries (when not system-managed)
- Network/HTTP libraries

### Medium Priority (Stability-Critical)  
- ML framework dependencies (tensorflow, numpy)
- Data processing libraries (pandas, scikit-learn)

### Low Priority (Build/Dev Tools)
- Build tools (setuptools, wheel)
- Linting/testing tools (when not affecting CI)

## Notes
- System conflicts prevent forced updates in this environment
- For containerized deployments, use specific version pins
- Regular dependency audits recommended quarterly
