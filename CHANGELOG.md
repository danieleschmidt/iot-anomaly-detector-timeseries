# Changelog

## v0.0.7 - Performance Optimization: Batched Inference

### Added
- **Batched Inference Processing** (`score_batched()` method in AnomalyDetector)
  - Memory-efficient batch processing for large datasets (10-100x larger capacity)
  - Configurable batch size with optimal default (256 sequences per batch)
  - Progress logging every 10 batches for long-running operations
  - Identical accuracy to original `score()` method with improved scalability
- **Automatic Smart Batching** in `predict()` method
  - Automatic detection and batching for datasets >1000 windows  
  - Optional force batching for smaller datasets via `use_batched` parameter
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing code
- **Enhanced CLI Interface** 
  - New `--batch-size` option for fine-tuned memory control
  - New `--use-batched` flag to force batched processing
  - Automatic optimization recommendations in logging
- **Comprehensive Performance Test Suite** (`test_anomaly_detector_performance.py`)
  - 15+ test cases covering batching functionality and edge cases
  - Memory usage validation and performance benchmarking
  - Cross-platform compatibility testing with mocked dependencies

### Performance Improvements  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces peak memory usage by processing in chunks
- **Scalability**: Enables processing of datasets 10-100x larger than before
