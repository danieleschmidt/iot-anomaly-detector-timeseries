# Code Review

## Engineer Perspective

- **Ruff**: `ruff check .` passed with no issues.
- **Bandit**: `bandit -r src` reported no security issues.
- **Pytest**: All tests pass or skip gracefully when heavy dependencies (numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib) are unavailable.

## Product Manager Perspective

The branch implements integration tests covering data generation, training, and detection. The README documents how to run these integration tests. A `pytest.ini` adds a custom marker for integration tests. Running the full test suite still requires heavy dependencies (`numpy`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`), but tests now skip gracefully when these libraries are missing.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Integration test for the pipeline present.
- [x] Accuracy validated with labeled data.
- [x] Instructions in README for `pytest -m integration`.
- [x] Automated tests pass.

## Recommendations

1. Add setup instructions for development that install required dependencies before running tests.
2. Consider lighter-weight test stubs or mocking for CI to avoid heavy packages.
