# Code Review

## Engineer Perspective

- **Ruff**: `ruff check .` passed with no issues.
- **Bandit**: `bandit -r src` reported no security issues.
- **Pytest**: Could not run due to missing heavy dependencies (numpy, tensorflow). The attempt failed during test collection.

## Product Manager Perspective

The branch implements integration tests covering data generation, training, and detection. The README documents how to run these integration tests. A `pytest.ini` adds a custom marker for integration tests. However, running the full test suite requires large dependencies (`numpy`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`). Without these installed, tests fail during import.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Integration test for the pipeline present.
- [x] Accuracy validated with labeled data.
- [x] Instructions in README for `pytest -m integration`.
- [ ] Automated tests pass (blocked by missing dependencies).

## Recommendations

1. Add setup instructions for development that install required dependencies before running tests.
2. Consider lighter-weight test stubs or mocking for CI to avoid heavy packages.
