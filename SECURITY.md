## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our IoT Anomaly Detection system seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to: security@terragonlabs.com
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with preliminary analysis
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible

### Security Measures

Our system implements multiple layers of security:

#### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Secure session management
- Regular security auditing with automated tools

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256)
- Secure key management
- Data anonymization capabilities
- GDPR compliance features
- Access logging and audit trails

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Network security controls
- Regular security updates
- Incident response procedures

#### Development Security
- Secure coding practices
- Code review requirements
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Dependency scanning and updates
- Security-focused pre-commit hooks

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security
1. **Environment Isolation**: Deploy in isolated environments with proper network segmentation
2. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Updates**: Keep all components updated with latest security patches
5. **Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management (never hardcode credentials)

### Data Security
1. **Encryption**: Enable encryption for all sensitive data
2. **Backup Security**: Secure backup storage with encryption
3. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
4. **Privacy Controls**: Enable data anonymization where required

### Network Security
1. **TLS/SSL**: Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications
2. **Firewall Rules**: Implement strict firewall rules
3. **VPN Access**: Use VPN for remote access to production systems
4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for anomalies

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Coordinated Disclosure
We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to:
- Understand and reproduce the vulnerability
- Develop and test a fix
- Coordinate the release of the security update
- Publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

### Bug Bounty
We are considering implementing a bug bounty program. Stay tuned for updates.

## Security Configuration

### Required Security Settings

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security settings
SECURITY_HARDENING_ENABLED=true
ENCRYPTION_AT_REST=true
AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true

FORCE_HTTPS=true
TLS_VERSION_MIN=1.3
HSTS_ENABLED=true

# Authentication settings
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=12
MFA_REQUIRED=true
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

#### Docker Security
```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
USER appuser

# Remove unnecessary packages
RUN apt-get remove --purge -y build-essential && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set secure file permissions
RUN chmod -R 755 /app && \
    chmod 700 /app/secrets
```

### Security Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all communications

- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management (planned)

### Audit Requirements
- Security audit logs retained for 1 year minimum
- Regular penetration testing (annually)
- Third-party security assessments
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
1. **Critical**: Active exploitation of vulnerabilities
2. **High**: Confirmed vulnerabilities with high impact
3. **Medium**: Potential security issues requiring investigation
4. **Low**: Minor security concerns or policy violations

### Response Procedures
