# ADR-001: LSTM Autoencoder Architecture for Anomaly Detection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select an appropriate machine learning architecture for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series data from IoT sensors. The system must handle:
- Multiple sensor streams with different characteristics
- Temporal dependencies in the data
- Real-time inference requirements
- Varying data patterns and seasonality

## Decision
We will use LSTM-based autoencoders as the primary architecture for anomaly detection.

## Rationale

### Advantages of LSTM Autoencoders
1. **Temporal Modeling**: LSTMs excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Autoencoders can learn normal patterns without labeled anomaly data
3. **Reconstruction Error**: Clear metric for anomaly scoring based on how well normal patterns can be reconstructed
4. **Flexibility**: Can handle multivariate inputs and variable sequence lengths
5. **Interpretability**: Reconstruction errors can be analyzed per feature and time step

### Alternatives Considered

#### Isolation Forest
- **Pros**: Fast training, good for high-dimensional data
- **Cons**: Doesn't capture temporal dependencies, less effective for time series

#### Transformer-based Models
- **Pros**: State-of-the-art for sequence modeling, attention mechanisms
- **Cons**: Higher computational requirements, more complex for deployment

#### Statistical Methods (ARIMA, etc.)
- **Pros**: Well-understood, lightweight
- **Cons**: Assumes stationarity, struggles with multivariate non-linear relationships

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- **Pros**: Generative modeling, uncertainty quantification
- **Cons**: More complex training, harder to interpret for anomaly detection

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Components
```
Input Layer (window_size, n_features)
↓
LSTM Encoder (128 units, return_sequences=False)
↓
Dense Bottleneck (latent_dim, typically 16-32)
↓ 
RepeatVector (window_size)
↓
LSTM Decoder (128 units, return_sequences=True)
↓
TimeDistributed Dense (n_features)
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Asymmetric design with compression in the middle
2. **Latent Dimension**: 16-32 dimensions to force learning of compact representations
3. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error for reconstruction
4. **Activation**: Tanh for LSTM layers, linear for output
5. **Window Size**: 30 time steps as default (configurable)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear anomaly scoring mechanism via reconstruction error
- Handles temporal dependencies naturally
- Proven approach for time series anomaly detection
- Relatively lightweight for deployment

### Negative  
- Requires sufficient training data to learn normal patterns
- May struggle with concept drift without retraining
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (window size, latent dimension)
- Limited to patterns seen during training

### Risks and Mitigations
1. **Overfitting**: Use dropout, early stopping, validation monitoring
2. **Threshold Selection**: Implement adaptive thresholding based on quantiles
3. **Concept Drift**: Monitor model performance and implement retraining triggers
4. **Scalability**: Implement batched inference and model optimization

## Monitoring and Success Metrics
- Reconstruction error distribution stability
- False positive/negative rates
- Inference latency < 100ms per window
- Model performance degradation detection

## Future Considerations
- Ensemble methods combining multiple autoencoders
- Attention mechanisms for better interpretability
- Online learning capabilities for continuous adaptation
- Integration with other anomaly detection methods
