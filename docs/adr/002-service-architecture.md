# ADR-002: Service-Oriented Architecture for IoT Anomaly Detection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The IoT Anomaly Detection system requires a modular, scalable architecture that can handle:
- High-volume streaming data processing
- Complex ML model lifecycle management
- Multiple integration points with external systems
- Independent scaling of different components
- Clear separation of concerns for maintainability

## Decision
We will implement a service-oriented architecture with the following layers:

### 1. Service Layer
Business logic encapsulated in specialized services:
- **AnomalyDetectionService**: Core detection logic and orchestration
- **ModelService**: Model training, versioning, and serving
- **DataIngestionService**: Data validation and preprocessing
- **NotificationService**: Alert generation and distribution
- **MonitoringService**: System health and performance tracking

### 2. Repository Layer
Data access patterns abstracted through repositories:
- **ModelRepository**: Model artifact storage and retrieval
- **MetricsRepository**: Performance metrics persistence
- **ConfigurationRepository**: System configuration management
- **AnomalyRepository**: Anomaly history and patterns

### 3. Controller Layer
API endpoints and request handling:
- **InferenceController**: Real-time anomaly detection endpoints
- **TrainingController**: Model training and management
- **MonitoringController**: Health checks and metrics
- **ConfigurationController**: System configuration

### 4. Integration Layer
External system integrations:
- **IoTGatewayIntegration**: IoT platform connectors
- **NotificationIntegration**: Email, Slack, webhook notifications
- **StorageIntegration**: Cloud storage adapters
- **MonitoringIntegration**: Prometheus, Grafana exporters

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modularity**: Each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled horizontally based on load
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Testability**: Services can be mocked and tested in isolation
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new services or modify existing ones

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Overhead**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Deployment**: More complex deployment and orchestration
- **Debugging**: Distributed system debugging challenges

### Mitigation
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Implement comprehensive logging and tracing
- Use circuit breakers for resilience
- Implement service discovery for dynamic scaling
- Create clear service contracts and documentation
