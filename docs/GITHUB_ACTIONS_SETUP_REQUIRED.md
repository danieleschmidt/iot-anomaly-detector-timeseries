# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Required

## Critical SDLC Gap Identified

This repository has comprehensive workflow templates in `docs/workflows-templates/` and `docs/github-workflows-setup/`, but **no active GitHub Actions workflows directory** (`.github/workflows/`).

## Required Action

**MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED**: As a Terry coding agent, I cannot create or modify GitHub workflows directly. You must manually create the `.github/workflows/` directory and copy the appropriate workflow files.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Workflows Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2. Copy Template Workflows

Copy the following workflow templates from `docs/github-workflows-setup/` to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
# Core CI/CD Pipeline
cp docs/github-workflows-setup/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows-setup/security.yml .github/workflows/  
cp docs/github-workflows-setup/release.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 3. Additional Recommended Workflows

Copy from `docs/workflows-templates/`:
```bash
cp docs/workflows-templates/dependency-update.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 4. Workflow Verification

After copying, verify workflows are properly configured:

```bash
# Check workflow syntax (requires GitHub CLI)
gh workflow list

# Test workflows locally (requires act)
act -l
```

## Available Workflow Templates

### Core Workflows (High Priority)

1. **`ci.yml`** - Main CI/CD pipeline
   - Runs tests, linting, security scans
   - Builds and validates Docker images
   - Generates coverage reports

2. **`security.yml`** - Security scanning
   - Dependabot security updates
   - CodeQL analysis
   - Container vulnerability scanning

3. **`release.yml`** - Release automation  
   - Automated versioning with semantic-release
   - Package building and publishing
   - Release notes generation

### Additional Workflows (Medium Priority)

4. **`dependency-update.yml`** - Enhanced dependency management
   - Automated dependency updates beyond Dependabot
   - Security vulnerability patching
   - Performance regression testing

## Integration Points

### Existing Configuration Compatibility

These workflows are designed to integrate with your existing:
- **pyproject.toml** - All tool configurations (ruff, black, mypy, pytest)
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates 
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Local development quality gates
- **Docker setup** - Container building and security scanning

### Secret Requirements

Configure these GitHub repository secrets:

```yaml
# Package publishing (if needed)
PYPI_API_TOKEN: "your-pypi-token"

# Container registry (if needed)  
DOCKER_USERNAME: "your-docker-username"
DOCKER_PASSWORD: "your-docker-password"

# Security scanning
SONAR_TOKEN: "your-sonar-token"  # Optional: SonarCloud integration
```

### Environment Protection

Configure branch protection rules:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require pull request reviews
- Restrict pushes to main branch
- Enable security alerts

## Post-Setup Validation

After workflow setup, validate the complete CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Create test PR** - Verify CI workflows run correctly
2. **Check security scans** - Ensure all security workflows pass  
3. **Test release process** - Validate release automation (on test branch)
4. **Monitor workflow runs** - Check Actions tab for any issues

## Benefits of Workflow Activation

Activating these workflows will provide:

- **Automated Quality Assurance** - Every PR validated
- **Security Monitoring** - Continuous vulnerability scanning  
- **Release Automation** - Streamlined version management
- **Performance Tracking** - Benchmarking on every change
- **Dependency Management** - Automated updates with testing

## Rollback Plan

If workflows cause issues:

1. **Disable specific workflow**: Add `if: false` to workflow
2. **Revert workflow changes**: Use git to restore previous state
3. **Emergency disable**: Rename `.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows-disabled/`

For assistance with GitHub Actions setup:
- Review workflow templates in `docs/github-workflows-setup/README.md`
- Check `docs/CI-CD-SETUP.md` for detailed configuration guide
- Consult repository maintainers via CODEOWNERS

**Priority**: CRITICAL - This is the primary missing component preventing full SDLC automation in this otherwise mature repository.
