# IoT Anomaly Detection System - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The IoT Anomaly Detection System is an enterprise-grade machine learning platform designed to automatically detect anomalies in multivariate time series data from IoT sensors. Using LSTM-based autoencoders, the system learns normal operational patterns and identifies deviations in real-time with minimal false positives.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
- IoT systems generate massive volumes of sensor data requiring continuous monitoring
- Manual monitoring is impractical and error-prone at scale
- Traditional threshold-based alerting produces excessive false positives
- Delayed anomaly detection can result in equipment damage, production losses, and safety incidents

### Solution Value
- **Automated Detection**: ML-based pattern recognition reduces manual oversight by 90%
- **Early Warning**: Detect anomalies before they escalate into failures
- **Cost Reduction**: Prevent equipment damage and unplanned downtime
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent sensor streams
- **Accuracy**: >90% detection accuracy with <10% false positive rate

## Project Scope
